Feedo app Testing
Feedo App here is for posting liking and put comment on those feeds. user can upload image as well as just post a text as post and all these will be stored in local storage.We also have some default post that commes from json file and we have used http service to get that data and this data will be automatically added to localstorage once its loaded from json file.

Below are the steps for checking it.
1) First one is to run the application we need to have one of server application it could be google crome server or any other.
2) Second default data will loaded from json and will be added to localstorage.
3) For creating post user can post image or text both at same time but one of them need to be added else it will throw error.
4) For liking and comment we have added two buttons for like and comment which we can perform both of the action.
